# WISER 2025 Quantum Walks and Monte Carlo Project

## Overview
This project implements quantum circuits to simulate statistical distributions using quantum walks and Monte Carlo methods. It demonstrates how quantum computing can generate and analyze Gaussian, exponential, and Hadamard (quantum walk) distributions, comparing quantum outputs with classical statistical targets.

## Features
- Quantum simulation of Galton board with configurable layers
- Supports Gaussian, exponential, and Hadamard distributions
- Realistic noise modeling to emulate quantum hardware errors
- Quantitative comparison using metrics like mean, variance, and Wasserstein distance
- Visualization of quantum and classical distribution overlaps

## Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- Qiskit
- NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib (`pip install numpy scipy matplotlib`)

## Usage
